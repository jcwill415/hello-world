Accounting and Technology

My name is Jenna Williams. I'm an accountant, and will soon begin the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exam. I'm really excited about programming, data analytics and visualization, and other skills that can be applied in fintech. Recently I've been doing coursework in automation, machine learning, and blockchain. 

Projects I'm working on right now are mostly related to Python and finaance, such as algorithmic training, web scraping for news to assess sentiment, and financial modeling to assess risk related to specific stocks. I'm building my stock portfolio using Python (in a papertrading account, for now). 

In the future, I aim to use Python and other programming skills in key accounting areas such as auditing, transaction reporting, and reconciliations. 

Other languages I've learned (and continue to work on) include: SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS< and JavaScript.

Thanks for reading! Happy coding.
